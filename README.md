# GettingTheHostStatusIn-vCenter
I wrote this script, more for tracking the status of hosts via zabbix. It is extensible, the code from here was taken as a basis: https://github.com/hautph/python-vcenter/blob/master/vsphere_info.py
In this project, Pyvmomi was used - this is the SDK for working with cvCenter. If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them
